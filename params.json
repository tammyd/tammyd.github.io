{"name":"tammyd.ca","tagline":"Just another developer with a website. ","body":"### Hey There!\r\n\r\nWelcome. For one reason or another, you've found my little corner of the web. Glad you came.\r\n\r\n### Who am I?\r\n\r\nGlad you asked. My name's Tammy. I'm a web developer, tech lead and metaphorical herder of cats professionally during the day in the Vancouver, BC Canada area. When not at work, I do a lot of the same as well, but the cat herding is a little more literal. Technology, development and these domesticated animals us humans call pets are passions of mine. \r\n\r\n### What are you working on?\r\n\r\nProfessionally, you can find me over at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tammydelahaye).\r\n\r\nPersonally, I have two projects on the go at the moment.\r\n\r\nThe first is [CatFoodDB](http://catfooddb.com/), a nutritional database for cats. There are dozens of databases for human food, this one is an equivalent for commercially prepared cat food.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I've just started developing for the [Pebble](https://getpebble.com/) line of smartwatches. More to come shortly on this topic!\r\n\r\nPreviously, I've stopped and started multiple projects over the years, some of which can be found in my [github](https://github.com/tammyd).\r\n\r\n### How can I get a hold of you?\r\n\r\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tammydelahaye) or [@tammydca](https://twitter.com/tammydca) (my very much neglected twitter account, but I do get email via it!)\r\n","google":"UA-1781879-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
