### Welcome

My name's Tammy. Professionally, I'm a web developer, technical & team lead, and metaphorical herder of cats in the Vancouver, BC Canada area. When not at work I do a lot of the same as well, but the cat herding is a little more literal. Technology, development and these domesticated animals us humans call pets are passions of mine. 

### What are you working on?

Professionally, you can find me over at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tammydelahaye).

Personally, I have two projects on the go at the moment.

The first is <a href="http://catfooddb.com" rel="nofollow">CatFoodDB</a>, a nutritional database for cats. There are dozens of databases for human food, this one is an equivalent for commercially prepared cat food.

I've also dabbled in developing for the [Pebble](https://getpebble.com/) line of smart watches. Since Pebble's been bought by Fitbit and effectively shuttered, I suspect this will be the last of this line of futzing.

Previously, I've stopped and started multiple projects over the years, some of which can be found in my [github](https://github.com/tammyd).

### How can I get a hold of you?

I can be reached via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tammydelahaye) or [@tammydca](https://twitter.com/tammydca).
